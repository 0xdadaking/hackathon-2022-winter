## Introduction
The scene of contract signing is widespread in all walks of life. Contracts interweaves into our business world, promoting the legitimate and stable development of business.
When signing a contract, both parties usually sign, seal, or fingerprint, which aims to provide the court with a proof of the legal identity of both parties and their willingness to sign the contract when a contract dispute arises.

e-signature is a digital upgrade of the contract signing scene in the era of web2.0. It aims to break the contract signing geographical restrictions and enable two or more parties to realize efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly contract signing scenarios across regions.

However, while gaining these advantages, the price is that people lose their most unique value:
1. The certificates and private information that can prove your identity will have to be hosted in a private centralized organization.
2. The signed contract will have to be kept in a private centralized institution.
The user's personal information, identity certificates, and contract documents will be "legally" occupied by a third-party central organization, and the user, as the real owner, can only be accessed under the authorization of such a third-party organization.

What's more serious is that as some large enterprises attach importance to privacy protection, they will often rely on the advantages of social resources to force these third-party centralized institutions to privatize the deployment of e-signature services for them. As a result, the counterparties of these large enterprises (employees, suppliers, customers, partners, etc.) have to entrust their private information, identity certificates, and contract documents to such a "fourth party" centralized organization, causing personal Re-dilution of ownership.

The DeSign e-signature platform aims to realize the vision that users' value assets (identity information, digital certificates, contract documents) belong to users based on the web3.0 ecology and the contract signing scenario, on the basis of the traditional advantages of web2.0, such as efficiency, low cost and environmental protection.

DeSign aims to provide customers with decentralized e-signature and contract management services. As a new generation of e-signature technology, on the basis of retaining the traditional advantages of web2.0 in efficiency, low cost and environmental protection, it realizes the vision that users' value assets (identity information, digital certificates, contract documents) belong to users.
