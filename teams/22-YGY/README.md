Project Name: DeSign

Start Time: 2022.11

## Introduction

Traditional electronic signature business usually requires enterprises or individuals to store digital certificates and contracts in RA institutions (centralized certificate management institutions), which is a security risk for individuals and enterprises.

Middle and large-sized enterprises (MLE) usually require privatization at a relatively cost to avoid the above risk. However, it will place their counterparts in higher risks for their private information and contracts would be owned and managed by MLE, instead of RA.
