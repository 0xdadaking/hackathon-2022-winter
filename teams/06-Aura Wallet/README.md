Users and dApps’ market are increasing rapidly as the development of Web3, a crypto wallet, as the portal of Web3, has become an important infrastructure. The crypto wallet itself has also developed from a single form, a browser-based EOA plug-in wallet, to multiple forms such as a mobile wallet, multisig wallet, smart contract wallet, etc.

A crypto wallet nowadays has been expected more than a wallet, it is responsible for diverse user scenarios. However, the majority of wallet products in the market are designed for experienced Web3 users, a traditional user is hardly to use a wallet seamlessly or understand how it works with tons of crypto-native features. With the influx of more and more traditional internet users, a user-friendly crypto wallets is needed to lower barriers to entry, making it easier for traditional Internet users to experience blockchain products.

Aura Wallet is developed based on the Flutter framework and native hybrid technology, which not only ensures the fluency and performance of the product itself but also supports more complex user scenarios in the future. At the same time, Aura Wallet supports multi-chain architecture and we provide plenty of development kits and comprehensive development documents to help developers to create their dApps. More importantly, we have optimized the overall business flow of Aura Wallet, enhanced the user experience of a crypto wallet, and provided more readable blockchain data of the wallet.

All in all, we believe that if the mainstream billions of Internet users in the future will come and use crypto products, then the crypto wallet should act as the first fundamental dApps which provide the same user-experienced on login and interacting with other dApps just like traditional Internet products.
