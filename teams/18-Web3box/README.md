> Risk Protocol provides accurate and timely risk management for Polkadot Ecology.

# Introduction

Risk Protocol provides risk assessment scores, risk reports and risk anomaly warnings for the users of Polkadot ecosystem, so that users can get timely and accurate information about Polkadot project risks, and screen out low-risk Polkadot project parties and avoid high-risk Polkadot project parties for investment decisions.

The final demo of Risk Protocol will be presented with a desktop application and a risk score API, with the risk score of Polkadot parallel chain as the core demo module, and provide Polkadot desktop wallet for risk assessment linkage of Polkadot assets, contracts and accounts.

# What problem is solved by what approach

- Problems:

Web3 asset security incidents are frequent, and users have invested or operated without sufficient understanding of the risks of various project parties, thus causing asset losses.

- Solutions:

Firstly, Risk Protocol will be integrated with Polkadot Relay Chain and Parallel Chain Asset Interface to provide Risk Protocol users with a more secure desktop Polkadot wallet, which can be linked to risk assessment for assets, contracts and accounts of Polkadot ecology

Secondly, Risk Protocol provides API interface for developers of Polkadot ecology to query and call the API interface to get accurate and timely information about the risk score, risk report, and subscription risk exception warning of Polkadot ecology project parties.

More, Risk Protocol will directly export the client product for investors of Polkadot ecology to directly query and understand the risk score of each parallel chain project at the front end.

# Architecture

Upper layer: Mac/Win client (including wallet and risk query)
