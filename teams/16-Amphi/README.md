* post bounty
* accept bounty
* translate task event
* task is overtime
* reject task

Front-end

## Amphi can do
**Lower cost for buyers.** when buyer publish a bounty on amphi, they will recognize they do not need to negotiate with the sales and bargain price, get translation service is easy like order a takeout.

**High quality service.** amphi have tripartite supervision mechanism and DAO to supervise the high quality of translation.

**More efficient transaction.** the translator and validator will feel they can get payment much faster than previous, they get paid 1 month a time once they finished, and now just 1 minute.

**Increase translators' revenure.** the translator and validator will find they can work more than usual and more efficient  and the AI tools are free.

## web2 translation company model vs amphi model

**web2 translation company model**

compare with web2 language service, The centralized PM is the limitation workload.

**amphi model**

amphi expand the workload limitation line. the task will not decide by only the company or the project manager, translator and validator can cooperate well and control the quality well here. normally, translator and validator stand the same side to serve buyer in web2 translation company, amphi's smart contract separate their responsibility that validator should control the quality of translator for  himself/herself, because the under standard quality will affect only validator's revenue not translator's. So the quality will be control between these two party. Additionally, amphi DAO member can vote for the better quality if there is proposal related.

Except business is onchain, we also provide opensource translation intelligent tools.
