We3social is a multi-chain social decentralized application software based on moonbeam

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:10,900
which can provide users with peer-to-peer social and information sharing functions

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:15,266
Let's take a look at how to use We3social's DAPP

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,066
First

5
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,000
open Tokenpocket or Imtoken

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or other wallets that support the moonbeam public chain

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,666
Then enter the We3social address in the browser

8
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,799
check and agree to the terms of service

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,733
and click "Start Exploring".

10
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,666
If you are logging in for the first time

11
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,800
you first need to click "Register",

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,700
then use any other email address to complete the account registration

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,566
and you can log in after successful registration

14
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,266
After entering the interface

15
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:57,033
you can choose to click the "Personal Center" icon in the upper left corner to complete the soul binding function in the settings

16
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:02,333
so that the system can provide you with a recommendation function to facilitate other users to find you

17
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,733
After completing the binding

18
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,266
return to the home page

19
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:29,366
and you can see that the system has automatically pushed some users for you

20
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:32,566
You can click on a user to view his profile and needs

21
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,733
and send a request to add WeChat

22
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,133
If you want to select the users to push by yourself

23
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:48,766
you can click here to customize the filter criteria you need

24
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:53,933
Anyone can see the DID identities of other users on the DID push square and get in touch with them

25
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,000
If you cannot filter the partners you need

26
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:01,466
you can click the "+ sign" in the lower right corner of the "Demand Square",

27
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,433
first edit your demand content

28
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,600
then add tags

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,666
and finally click "Publish".

30
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:09,333
After the release is successful

31
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:13,766
other users can take the initiative to contact you through the content you publish

32
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:20,133
All the posts you have published and the friends you have made can be viewed through the "Personal Center" page

33
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,000
Finally

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,733
We3social also provides a DID identity purchase function

35
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,700
which is the value-added service part of the project

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,700
Users can choose to pay to register for Moonbeam DID to obtain additional services

37
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:39,666
First click the "DID Unlock" option on the "Personal Center" page

38
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,833
then click the "Price" at the bottom

39
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,766
connect to the Moonbeam wallet and send the signature to complete the payment

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,400
Currently the project is in the early testing stage

41
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,266
so we don't need to pay

42
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,666
just send the signature
